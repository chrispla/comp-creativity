This repo contains the PyTorch implementation of [Audio Flamingo 2: An Audio-Language Model with Long-Audio Understanding and Expert Reasoning Abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03983). Audio Flamingo 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across over 20 benchmarks, using only a 3B parameter small language model. It is improved from our previous [Audio Flamingo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01831). 

- We introduce two datasets, AudioSkills for expert audio reasoning, and LongAudio for long audio understanding, to advance the field of audio understanding.

- Audio Flamingo 2 has advanced audio understanding and reasoning capabilities. Especially, Audio Flamingo 2 has expert audio reasoning abilities, and can understand long audio up to 5 minutes.

- Audio Flamingo 2 outperforms larger and proprietary LALMs across 20+ benchmarks, despite being smaller (3B) and trained exclusively on public datasets.

## Main Results

Audio Flamingo 2 outperforms prior SOTA models including GAMA, Audio Flamingo, Qwen-Audio, Qwen2-Audio, LTU, LTU-AS, SALMONN, AudioGPT, Gemini Flash v2, Gemini Pro v1.5, and GPT-4o-audio on a number of understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

## Audio Flamingo 2 Architecture

Audio Flamingo 2 uses a cross-attention architecture similar to [Audio Flamingo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01831) and [Flamingo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14198). Audio Flamingo 2 can take up to 5 minutes of audio inputs.
